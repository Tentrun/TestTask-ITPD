Test Job

Create a time attendance application. After completion, you need to upload the project to any open GIT repository.

This application should be able to:

Task name (Link to edit page)
Start time
End time
On the page with the table of tasks, you need to display the total time spent on tasks from the table.
Above the table, you need to display the DatePicker to filter tasks by date, as well as display a drop-down list of projects, to filter by project.

Time counting

The column "The amount of time spent on the task" is dynamic and is calculated by the formula:

"Amount of time spent on the task" = "End time" - "Start time"

If the Start time is specified and the End Time is not specified, then the task is considered to be in progress and the end time is considered from the current time. DateTime.Now. Time counting must be implemented on the server.

Provide filling of all tables in the database with test data when updating migrations.
